# Comparing Alcohol Content in Red and White Wines : STAT-201-Group-Project-23

Wine Quality Data Set: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

## Introduction 

For those who drink wine, knowing the alcohol content of the wine is often very important to them. The alcohol content of both red and white wines is a point of interest for both consumers and producers.

For the consumer, alcohol equivalence can factor in purchasing decisions, especially with the type of liquor, brand, and the moderation in which the liquor is consumed. On the other hand, suppliers must maintain a consistent alcohol significance as several jurisdictions require a precise alcohol percentage listed on wine labels (The Nutrition Source, 2012). Furthermore, long-term cooperage can cause changing alcohol concentration levels, and it is thus essential that manufacturers predict and confirm the changing alcohol equivalencies and are precise to the listing on the wine label for utmost quality and satisfaction (The Nutrition Source, 2012). Additionally, the ethanol carries the scent that can differentiate different wines, and the alcohol equivalency is critical with this, too, meaning that differing alcohol percentages can change the taste and smell of the liquor (P. Cortez, n.d.).

Evidently, the alcohol content of wine is a crucial factor for both sides of the business and can detail a lot about the quality of the wine. It is thus imperative that these measurements are accurate, and as such, it has prompted the following study.

## About This Study 

This study compares the mean alcohol content of wines from red and white wine datasets. The first data set contains 1599 red wines with data on their composition and quality. The other data set includes 4898 white wines with data on their composition and quality. These datasets will help to correlate the composition and quality of the two different types of wines from various data points. A hypothesis test will be performed comparing the mean alcohol content of the two types of wine, and a confidence interval of the difference in means of alcohol content in the two types of wine (red and white) will be obtained. Another aspect of this report will be to estimate this confidence interval using asymptotics and bootstrapping and comparing the two techniques. Along with this, the quantiles for the alcohol concentration in red and white wine will be analyzed.
